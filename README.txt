Description:
Coder is my approach for compress binary files grouping bits.

To get it up:
Create a root folder named "in" and save there your input files.
Create a root folder named "out", there will be save the output file.
Pass your input file name in the java main arguments:
java -jar Main.class [inputfolder/inputFile]
Or run the gradle "run" task
putting your input file in the root gradle.properties file.

If you have questions don't hesitate to ask.
